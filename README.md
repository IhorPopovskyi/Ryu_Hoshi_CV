# Homepage:
🤟 My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

## Information:

👨‍🎓 This is an educational github repository for BSA20.

## Why I choose Ryu and not Donald Trump :

| Name | Сult of the character  | Wrote nonsense on twitter| Guilty of the events in the Capitol | Politely described his order to me | Scary to meet him in a dark alleyy | Sense of humor |
| :---------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| Ryu       | Yes  | No| No| Yes | No | No
| Donald Trump     | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No |

### 👍 Thanks @volodymyr-kushnir for the first lecture about GIT.
